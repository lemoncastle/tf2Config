### Notes
- I played pyro for [Highlander Gaming](https://rgl.gg/Public/Team?t=12551&r=24) So I messed with the config a bit.
- I didn't like any of the crosshairs on cfg.tf or any other ones so I decided to make my own. I followed [this](https://www.teamfortress.tv/37767/how-to-make-vtf-crosshairs) guide on how to do it and they turned out pretty good.
- I'm only using them on scout,pyro,engineer as those are the only classes I play right now.
- Reorganized class cfg's  to make them look nice. that's about it.
- Replaced killsound to the krunker headshot killsound - edited slightly
- Playing another season of RGL (subbing -can't play defaults :0 )
- Season concluded 4-4, didn't scrim as much as I wanted :/
- updated crosshairs again and killsound was volume cut by ~5db
